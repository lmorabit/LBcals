Abstract:
    We present the description and early results of the mJy Imaging VLBA
    Exploration at 20cm (mJIVE-20). mJIVE-20 is a large project on the
    Very Long Baseline Array which is systematically inspecting a large
    sample of mJy radio sources, pre-selected from the Faint Images of the
    Radio Sky at Twenty cm (FIRST) survey made with the Very Large Array,
    to identify any compact emission that may be present. The survey is
    being undertaken using filler time on the VLBA, which utilizes short
    segments scheduled in bad weather and/or with a reduced number of
    antennas, during which no highly rated science projects can be
    scheduled. The newly available multifield capability of the VLBA makes
    it possible for us to inspect of the order of 100 sources per hour of
    observing time with a 6.75{sigma} detection sensitivity of
    approximately 1mJy/beam. The results of the mJIVE-20 survey are made
    publicly available as soon as the data are calibrated. After 18 months
    of observing, over 20000 FIRST sources have been inspected, with 4336
    very long baseline interferometry detections. These initial results
    suggest that within the range 1-200mJy, fainter sources are somewhat
    more likely to be dominated by a very compact component than brighter
    sources. Over half of all arcsecond-scale mJy radio sources contain a
    compact component, although the fraction of sources that are dominated
    by milliarcsecond scale structure (where the majority of the arcsecond
    scale flux is recovered in the mJIVE-20 image) is smaller at around
    30%-35%, increasing toward lower flux densities. Significant
    differences are seen depending on the optical classification of the
    source. Radio sources with a stellar/point-like counterpart in the
    Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) are more likely to be detected
    overall, but this detection likelihood appears to be independent of
    the arcsecond-scale radio flux density. The trend toward higher radio
    compactness for fainter sources is confined to sources that are not
    detected in SDSS or that have counterparts classified as galaxies.
    These results are consistent with a unification model of active
    galactic nuclei in which less luminous sources have on average slower
    radio jets, with lower Doppler suppression of compact core emission
    over a wider range of viewing angles.

Description:
    The mJy Imaging VLBA Exploration at 20cm (mJIVE-20) is a large project
    on the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) which is systematically
    inspecting a large sample of mJy radio sources, pre-selected from the
    Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters (FIRST; Becker et
    al. 2012, cat. VIII/90) survey made with the Very Large Array (VLA),
    to identify any compact emission that may be present.

    The mJIVE-20 survey was approved with an initial allocation of 200hr
    of observing time at the filler level priority (VLBA project code
    BD161), and has now been extended to a total of 600hr (VLBA project
    code BD170).

Note (1): Denotes a source for which the signal-to-noise ratio of the
     single Gaussian fit was less than the cutoff value of 6.75, but for
     which the peak image pixel exceeded a threshold set based on expected
     image noise, triggering a manual inspection of the data which verified
     this source to be real.
