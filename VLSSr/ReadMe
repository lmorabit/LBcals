Abstract:
    We present the results of a recent re-reduction of the data from the
    Very Large Array (VLA) Low-frequency Sky Survey (VLSS). We used the
    VLSS catalogue as a sky model to correct the ionospheric distortions
    in the data and create a new set of sky maps and corresponding
    catalogue at 73.8MHz. The VLSS Redux (VLSSr) has a resolution of 75",
    and an average map rms noise level of {sigma}~0.1Jy/beam. The clean
    bias is 0.66x{sigma} and the theoretical largest angular size is 36'.
    Six previously unimaged fields are included in the VLSSr, which has an
    unbroken sky coverage over 9.3sr above an irregular southern boundary.
    The final catalogue includes 92964 sources. The VLSSr improves upon
    the original VLSS in a number of areas including imaging of large
    sources, image sensitivity, and clean bias; however the most critical
    improvement is the replacement of an inaccurate primary beam
    correction which caused source flux errors which vary as a function of
    radius to nearest pointing centre in the VLSS.

Description:
    The VLSSr reprocessed all of the data from the original VLSS project.
    The observations were made between 2001 and 2007, under VLA observing
    programs AP397, AP441, AP452, and AP509. The sky was divided into a
    roughly hexagonal grid of 523 pointing centres, at a spacing of
    8.6{deg}. The bandwidth used was 1.56MHz centred at 73.8MHz. Fields in
    the range -10<DEC<80{deg} were observed in the VLA B configuration,
    while those at DEC<-10{deg} and DEC>80{deg} were observed in the BnA
    configuration to compensate for beam elongation at low elevations.
    Further details of the observational setup are given in Cohen et al.
    (VLSS; 2007, Cat. VIII/79).

    The final catalogue contains 92964 entries. Of these, roughly 3 per
    cent have no match in the NVSS within 60 arcsec of the fitted
    position. However many unmatched sources are actually components of
    larger sources which may be fit differently in the two catalogues.

    The global rms position error is 3.3 arcsec in RA and 3.5 arcsec in
    declination.
