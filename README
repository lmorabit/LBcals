Instructions on how to use:

-----------
Installing R

On linux systems, R can be installed by running

sudo apt-get install R

But it may already be present!  To check simply try to start R:

user@mycomputer$ R

You will need to do this to make sure the proper packages are installed.

Once you start R, do the following:

>install.packages('astro')
>install.packages('celestial')
>install.packages('stringr')
>install.packages('argparser')

After the first install.packages() command, a gui will pop up asking you to select a mirror for the session.


-----------
Running the script

Once R (and the appropriate packages) have been installed, you're ready to go!

To see how to run, simply try:

user@mycomputer$ Rscript LBcals.r -h

And this will show you python-style help/instructions.

PLEASE NOTE!! The script expects you to run it in the same directory as the accompanying data directories 
		that contain the catalogs (i.e., in the same directory where the directories mJIVE, VLSS, etc. are)
		If you would like to change this, there is a "catalog_location" parameter in the script that can be changed.
